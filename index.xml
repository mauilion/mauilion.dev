      <description>Setup I am looking to validate a set of changes produced by this PR.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77523
In this post I want to show a few things.
 setup a go environment. build kind checkout the k8s.io/kubernetes source bring up a cluster to repoduce the issue. build an image based on Andrews changes bring up a cluster with that image validate that the changes have the desired affect.  Prerequisites There is a pretty handy tool called gimme put out by the travis-ci folks.</description>

      <title>Using MetalLb with Kind</title>

      <description>Preamble: When using metallb with kind we are going to deploy it in l2-mode. This means that we need to be able to connect to the ip addresses of the node subnet. If you are using linux to host a kind cluster. You will not need to do this as the kind node ip addresses are directly attached.
If you are using a Mac this tutorial may not be super useful as the way Docker Desktop works on a Mac doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose the &amp;ldquo;docker network&amp;rdquo; to the underlying host.</description>

      <description>On 4/7/2019 I had the opportunity to talk to folks that attended the SF Kubernetes meetup Anaplan about kind!
It&amp;rsquo;s a great project and I end up using kind everyday to validate or develop designs for Kubernetes clusters.
The slides that I presented are here: mauilion.github.io/kind-demo and a link to the repository with the deck and the content used to bring up the demo cluster is here: github.com/mauilion/kind-demo

In the talk I dug in a bit about what kind and kubeadm are and what problems they solve.</description>

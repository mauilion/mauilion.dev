      <description>Just got back from vacation and I am excited to bring another blog post on something I don&amp;rsquo;t think is terribly well explained. Docker in Docker (DinD) is an interesting way to make use of the docker and containerization in general.
The most interesting thing to me is that there are at least two technical definitions of what DinD is.
 You have a node where docker is running and you expose the docker socket on that node to a container that has been started.</description>

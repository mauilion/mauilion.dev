      <description>On 4/7/2019 I had the opportunity to talk to folks that attended the SF Kubernetes meetup Anaplan about kind!
It&amp;rsquo;s a great project and I end up using kind everyday to validate or develop designs for Kubernetes clusters.
The slides that I presented are here: mauilion.github.io/kind-demo and a link to the repository with the deck and the content used to bring up the demo cluster is here: github.com/mauilion/kind-demo

In the talk I dug in a bit about what kind and kubeadm are and what problems they solve.</description>
